This repository contains the code for SatStressGUI, a program which models stresses in icy satellites.

SatStressGUI V4.0 was developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology
and is based on SatStressGUI.
SatStressGUI was developed by the Planetary Geology Research group at the University of Idaho.
SatStress GUI is based on SatStress, which was designed by Zane Selvans and is available at
http://code.google.com/p/satstress and most recently at https://github.com/zaneselvans/satstress

SatStressGUI 2.3 has been created upon efforts by
Alex Patthoff, Robert Pappalardo, Jonathan Kay, Lee Tang
Simon Kattenhorn, C.M. Cooper, Emily S. Martin,
David Dubois, Ben J. Ayton, Jessica B. Li.
